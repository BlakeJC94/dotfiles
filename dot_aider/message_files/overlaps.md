Can you write a report of any potential duplicate utility functions across these services?
Only list overlaps containing two or more functions.
If there's overlap, group functions together by purpose and provide a short summary of their differences.
Feel free to suggest steps to refactor, but DO NOT make any edits to the files.
Only output your findings to OVERLAPS.md
